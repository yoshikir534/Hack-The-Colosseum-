It is a "simulation" of 2d flight trajectories for rockets, with adjustable parameters.

This project is scuffed, and it definetly shows in the code.
I mainly used copilot to help me understand the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation and help apply it in python, logarithms, and some of the other calculations as that isn't my forte. The rest however, was made with visual studio code, so i don't know whether this gets disqualified, sorry in advance.
